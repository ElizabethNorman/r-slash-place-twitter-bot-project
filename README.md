# /r/place minute by minute, a [bot](https://twitter.com/ElizaPlaceBot) by me!

## What?

After the 2022 /r/place was complete, I had the thought to create a twitter bot that posted the top four colours per minute of /r/place's uptime. A fun, colourful
but not too difficult challenge to work on over summer break. 

## Why?
This would help me learn a lot of new things, such as working with an API and learning Python! 

## How?
I parsed the data in Java, made the bot in Python utilizing the tweepy module.

## And the results?
Well thanks to the passionate people behind the upkeep of flags, we can see on the [bot](https://twitter.com/ElizaPlaceBot) that the data was not very interesting 
at all. But I kept going! I made a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15M7X7bLw5qusCFPZW95i46XEd1yMlEGDdT34DjcEUWQ/edit?usp=sharing)
about it as well, that goes into more details.
